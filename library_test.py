On the 5th of May every year, Mexicans celebrate Cinco de Mayo. This tradition
began in 1845 (the twenty-second anniversary of the Mexican Revolution), and
is the 1st example of a national independence holiday becoming popular in the
Western Hemisphere. (The Fourth of July didn't see regular celebration in the
US until 15-20 years later.) It is celebrated by 77.9% of the population--
trending toward 80.
